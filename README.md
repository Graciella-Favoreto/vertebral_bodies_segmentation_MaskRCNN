# Automated Segmentation of lumbar vertebral bodies into MRI using Mask R-CNN


This repository hosts my final paper in biomedical informatics, focused on leveraging cutting-edge computer vision and machine learning techniques to segment vertebral bodies. The study proposes the use of the Mask R-CNN Convolutional Neural Network architecture for the automated segmentation of lumbar vertebral bodies in MRI scans. This work was developed at the USP Faculty of Medicine in Ribeir√£o Preto, the images are not publicly available, but you can contact Prof Paulo if you need them pmarques@fmrp.usp.br

# Mask R-CNN
Mask R-CNN is a versatile framework for segmenting object instances, capable of efficiently detect objects in images by generating high-performance segmentation masks quality for each instance

# Key Features

* Automated segmentation of lumbar vertebral bodies using Mask R-CNN.
* Application on MRI images from 63 postmenopausal female patients.
* Preprocessing includes 3D to 2D conversion, mask handling, and dimension correction.
* Model training and validation included.

# Results

* mAP (Mean Average Precision) of 0.92 for testing and 0.98 for validation.
* Dice validation scores of 0.88 for testing and 0.93 for validation.
* These metrics underscore the model's efficiency in this specific application.
